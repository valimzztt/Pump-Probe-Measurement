# Pump-Probe Measurement Program
This program controls a lock-in amplifier and a 3-Axis Motion Controller. 


## Purpose of Program 
The program lets the user control one axis of the motion controller to retrieve the voltage/current data. 

## Start a procedure
A procedure can be composed of more iterations and the user can decide whether they want to have the average of the n iterations or they want to have access to the raw data for each run. 
Before starting the measurements, the user needs to select the axis that will be controlled and the corresponding range covered by the stage. 



## Details 
The lock-in amplifier used is a SRS830 LOCK-IN AMPLIFIER (https://www.thinksrs.com/downloads/pdfs/manuals/SR830m.pdf)
The 3-Axis Motion controller is a Newport ESP300 (https://www.manualslib.com/manual/1601201/Newport-Esp300-Series.html).
